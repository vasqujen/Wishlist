## Notes
Throughout the project, I had a hard time implementing the adapter class to work with my Main activity. I knew i had to create an array to allow 
for the passing of the editText into the textView, but i had a hard time with connecting them. I managed to get the layouts correct and they worked,
but could not pass in the text.
